GoT SNA Notes

- events.csv: provides character IDs, events, and details of event.
- characters.csv: provides characterID, Birth Name, and isDead/Captured/Hurt

Inital setup:
- extract character IDs and event (killed) == edges
- extract character IDs and Character name == nodes

Possible network dataset output:

Derived from D3.js example: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045
"nodes":[
    {"name":"Myriel","group":1},
    {"name":"Napoleon","group":1},
    ],
  "links":[
    {"source":1,"target":0,"value":1},
    {"source":2,"target":0,"value":8},
    ]
    }

Or just create a NetworkX file
